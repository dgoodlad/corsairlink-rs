# Corsair Link in Rust

An experimental app for talking to my Corsair H110i over its custom USB HID protocol.

Let's be honest, I'm re-inventing the wheel here in order to learn a bit more about how this thing works, about reverse engineering USB, and to learn Rust. You probably don't want to derive much from this project :)
